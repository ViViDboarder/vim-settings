About
====

These are just my Vim settings that I like to keep synced between my computers for convenience

I am not the original creators of many of the files included in the dot_vim directory and only re-host them out of convienince. If I am missing any licensing information I'd be happy to attach it.

Most of the packages have been replaced in favor of using vundle so that I never have to update my repo with any plugin updates.

Install
=======

    git clone https://github.com/ViViDboarder/Vim-Settings.git
    cd Vim-Settings
    ./vim-sync-append.sh
